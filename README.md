# RuboCop ErgoServ

ErgoServ shared configs for RuboCop.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
group :development, :test  do
  # version released to RubyGems (most probably outdated)
  gem 'rubocop-ergoserv', require: false

  # or latest version from the repository (recommended)
  gem 'rubocop-ergoserv',
    git: 'https://github.com/ergoserv/rubocop-ergoserv',
    require: false
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubocop-ergoserv

## Usage

Update your `.rubocop.yml` file with the following directives:

```yaml
inherit_gem:
  rubocop-ergoserv:
    - config/default.yml
```

Now, run:

    $ bundle exec rubocop

*Note:* You may have to use `bundle exec` to make `inherit_gem` directive work correctly.

You do not need to include `rubocop` directly in your application's dependencies. `rubocop-ergoserv` will include a required versions of `rubocop`, `rubocop-performance`, `rubocop-rails`, `rubocop-rake` and `rubocop-rspec`.
